Web API built with Node and Express.  It wraps
[Dropbox's zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) library just in case
you need to verify a password's strength on both the client and server
with a guarantee of the same result from both.

# Environmental config

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) must be installed.

Optionally, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and/or
[cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/)

# Initial app config
`npm install`

# Testing
`npm test`

# Starting app

## For normal people

`npm start`

`npm run start:dev` for automatic node restart when code changes.

## For studs

 `npm run docker:start`

# Available API's

> POST is required for security reasons.  Think of the call as a request
to create a strength estimation.  API assumes SSL protocol.
